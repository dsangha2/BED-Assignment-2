# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Debugging Employee Creation

- **Breakpoint Location:**  
  src/api/v1/controllers/employeeController.ts, line 61.
- **Objective:**  
  Check that the `createEmployee` function gets the right data from the request and creates a new employee correctly.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**  
  - `req.body` holds the employee details (name, position, department, email, phone, branchId).  
  - The call to `employeeService.createEmployee(req.body)` returns a new employee object that includes a generated `id`.
- **Call Stack:**  
  - The execution starts in the controllerâ€™s `createEmployee`, calls the service function, and then returns the response.
- **Behavior:**  
  - When stopped at the breakpoint, I see that the correct data is passed to the service and a new employee object is produced.

### Analysis

- I learned that the employee creation process is working as expected.  
- There was no unexpected behavior; the data flow from the request to the service is correct.  
- The code is clear, but in a real-world app, I might add extra error handling or logging.  
- This debugging confirms that the employee creation endpoint is functioning, which is a key part of the project.


## Scenario 2: Debugging Branch Update

- **Breakpoint Location:**  
  src/api/v1/controllers/branchController.ts, line 64.
- **Objective:**  
  Ensure that the `updateBranch` function correctly reads the branch ID and the updated data, and then returns the updated branch details.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**  
  - `req.params.id` correctly contains the branch ID.  
  - `req.body` contains the updated branch information (like a new name or address).
- **Call Stack:**  
  - The function is called in the controller, then the branch service is invoked, and the result is sent back.
- **Behavior:**  
  - At the breakpoint, the function finds the branch, applies the updates, and returns the updated branch object.

### Analysis

- I learned that the branch update functionality is working properly.  
- No unexpected behavior was observed.  
- The code is simple and effective, though adding more logging in a production setting could help.  
- This confirms that the branch update endpoint is solid, which is important for managing branch data.


## Scenario 3: Debugging Get Employees by Department

- **Breakpoint Location:**  
  src/api/v1/controllers/employeeController.ts, line 135.
- **Objective:**  
  Verify that the function correctly filters the list of employees by the department provided in the request.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**  
  - `req.params.department` contains the department name (for example, "QA").  
  - The full list of employees is retrieved from the service, and then a filter is applied to select only those with a matching department (ignoring case).
- **Call Stack:**  
  - The function calls `employeeService.getAllEmployees`, applies the filter, and then sends the filtered list as a response.
- **Behavior:**  
  - At the breakpoint, the filtering works as expected; only the employees from the specified department are selected.

### Analysis

- I learned that the filtering logic by department is implemented correctly.  
- There was no unexpected behavior during filtering.  
- While the code is simple and easy to understand, adding inline comments could make it even clearer for future developers.  
- This debugging step boosts my confidence that the logical endpoints (like filtering by department) are working well, which is a key part of the assignment.
